# Building-a-Restaurant-Success-Model-Using-Yelp-Data
Our project focuses on predicting the ratings and evaluating the popularity of a restaurant after detecting fake reviews and disregarding them. Our project will provide a comparative analysis of different supervised learning algorithms for predictions as well as fake review detection by using data from Yelp. We aim to come up with an accurate model for prediction at the end of our endeavors .
